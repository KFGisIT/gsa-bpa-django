#User Story#
##Melanie - The Soccer Mom Down the Street##
###Background###
Melanie and George live in Everytown, USA with their three kids George, Jr., Brittany, and Brendan. She drives a late model mini-van, spends her evenings/weekends on her kids' soccer, and relaxes each night watching the evening news. She worries about her family's health and carefully watches what her kids and husband eat.

###Interview with Melanie###

The kids all keep me hopping with three different soccer practice schedules, matches, tournaments and scrimmages. 
Since we live in the tri-state area; and with the schedules of George Jr & Brittany, we're *always* crossing states lines for games. 

After the PTA meeting last week, a few of us were talking about the latest food recall, 
and I mentioned how worried I was about the food we eat and how much time it took going through recall notices to see if our area was affected. 
One of my friends told that she just started using a new website to check government postings for food enforcement action for our area and wherever they traveled.

I immediately pulled out my phone and bookmarked the site. 
I had always been nervous about food recalls when we're traveling, and this seems like the solution :)
All I have to do is punch in the state where I am and I can see a list of all of the recalls in the area! It's amazing.

One of the things that struck me is how cute the site is. 
The design makes it easy to see information where I am, or where my parents live out of state, or wherever we happen to be traveling, and understand what I'm seeing. 
It even makes it easier to read. 
These recalls can be seriously depressing to pour over, and somehow it seems much more friendly now.
 
I was happy to see that I can check the same kind of information for pharmacies and drug recalls in the area. 
The kids always seem to be getting hurt, and after a 3 hour drive with the kids and four hours of games, I need a few tylenol.
I never even thought about checking the recalls on them before, now I can't imagine going into a corner pharmacy without looking at Yuck.io first.

Now that I know I can just click a switch, I've been spending more time on the site in the last month to make sure none of George's heart medicine is on the yuck-list.
At first he called me paranoid for always checking the site, but lately he's even on it at work to make sure none of the medicine he uses at his dental practices is showing up on the yuck-list.

Since the other local moms and I stay in touch on facebook and I've been getting more twitter followers from the school, 
I really like the simple way to post a yuck from the yuck-list to my wall or tweet a yuck to get the word out.
